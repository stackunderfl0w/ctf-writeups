The first flag was trying different inputs over and over becuase the moves were not randomized.
A quick look with ghidra shows the hardcoded moves.

The second was similar.
A quick look with ghidra shows the moves are generated with a somewhat crypotographic looking function using the name entered as a string. Put the same name in and we have a fixed state we can brute force.
