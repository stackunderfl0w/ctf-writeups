The chalenge is to locate a flag on a server with only the builtin bash commands

The location was found with shopt to enable ** to wildcard to any subdirectory

root@e499e7ef5062:/# shopt -s globstar
root@e499e7ef5062:/# echo **/flag.txt
usr/lib/dpkg/util/flag.txt

Eventually I figured out we can use mapfile to read the contents of the file

root@e499e7ef5062:/# mapfile -t lines < usr/lib/dpkg/util/flag.txt
printf '%s\n' "${lines[@]}"
osu{!right_where_i_left_it!}
