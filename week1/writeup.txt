Dr. B. Breaker's Barely Bestirring Brick Breaker!

A quick look at the source code shows that the score is sent over to a server for authentication. A simple solution was just to use the javascript console to set the score manually and the flag pops up.




Dr. Ralph Fleur's Baffling Raffle

	the random numbers are sent over to the server as

    let response = await fetch(`/raffle?field1=${a}&field2=${b}&field3=${c}&field4=${d}&field5=${e}`);

    looking at the server.js the values are parsed as

        if (!guesses.field1 || parseInt(guesses.field1) > digits[0] || parseInt(guesses.field1) < digits[0]) {

    I thought, I wonder how javascript would handle non integer inputs.

    and the flag is returned to the browser
